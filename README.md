# cloud-native-antipatterns-via-negativa
Instead of looking at patterns ("cloud-native") only, one should perhaps start with the anti-patterns. Starting with anti-patterns might be more effective -- not doing the wrong thing and/or avoiding mistakes, by extension (or by subtraction), also partly means doing the right thing.    For example, lifting and shifting a legacy application to the cloud does not magically make it "cloud-native". Lifting and shifting is to me an anti-pattern.   This method of “subtractive epistemology” (i.e., the process of obtaining knowledge via subtraction) is also called Via Negativa. Via Negativa is the Process of Making Good Decisions By Eliminating Bad Ones  Anti-patterns is a form of via-negativa.
